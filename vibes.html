            <h2 class="project-subtitle">Background</h2>
            <p class="white-text">Vibes is a mobile application that allows users to create collaborative playlists with music from Spotify. However, a user is only allowed to add to the playlist when they are in the physical vicinity of the event. The front end was built with React Native, and the backend was built with MongoDB with a little help from th Spotify API. See the frontend repo <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-19S/project-goodvibesonly">here</a> and the backend <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-19S/project-api-goodvibesonly">here</a>. This project was created as a final project for my class <a class="text-link" href="http://cs52.me/">CS52</a>, in which the only instructions were to build something cool with what we had learned.</p>
            <h2 class="project-subtitle">My Contribution</h2>
            <p class="white-text">As this was a group project, and we had a small amount of time to finish everything, we split up the workload amongst team members. I worked exclusively on the backend, using axios to make Spotify API calls, and Mongo to query our database of user-created playlists.</p>
            <h2 class="project-subtitle">What Went Well</h2>
            <p class="white-text">I was lucky to work with an amazing team of women on this project who were able to mentor me throught the whole process of design and development. I found Mongo to be easy to scale up from the "practice projects" I had done earlier to this larger and more complex project.</p>
            <h2 class="project-subtitle">What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
            <p class="white-text">When I began this project, I still did not feel entirely comfortable with the React framework, especially regarding how data is passed around. Thanks to this, I spent longer than I would have liked figuring out how to structure the varous controllers, and how to call each method.</p>
            <h2 class="project-subtitle">What I Learned</h2>
            <p class="white-text">I learned it is possible to effectively delegate responsibility for different components of a project if there is strong enough communication. I also solidified my understanding of React and MongoDB.</p>
