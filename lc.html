            <h2 class="project-subtitle">Background</h2>
            <p class="white-text"> A website for Dartmouth students to find love before the summer ends. Dartmouth students can log in with their student credentials to crush on other students. If the crushes are mutual, they are matched. If the crush s one-sided, it remains anonymous. I used Dartmouth CAS authentication, MongoDB, and passport to make the backend, while the frontend is just a simple ejs layout. %97 of students signed up.</p>
            <h2 class="project-subtitle">My Contribution</h2>
            <p class="white-text">This whole project was pair-programmed with a friend in the space of 3 days. We contributed equally to the project and did all of the major programming together, splitting up easier tasks like autocompletion between us.</p>
            <h2 class="project-subtitle">What Went Well</h2>
            <p class="white-text">Since we were just two people coding together, we were able to move the project along very quickly, thanks to constant exchanges of ideas.</p>
            <h2 class="project-subtitle">What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
            <p class="white-text">We initially had no idea how to use the Dartmouth authentication system, or even what CAS was. We ran into big roadblocks here because when we had a user log in, we were not given back any kind of unique id to query our own database of students with. Our solution was some complex string sectioning and nested queries to make sure we were getting the user we meant to get. While we eventually got it to work, it definitely felt like a hacky workaround.</p>
            <h2 class="project-subtitle">What I Learned</h2>
            <p class="white-text">I learned a lot about authentication systems, cookie sessions, and how to write meaningful queries.</p>
