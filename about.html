          <p>I am a computer science major at Dartmouth, with a motley assortment of interest, activities, and goals. Computer science has been the root of my personality (dorky) and the source of my aspirations (lofty) since I was 10 and first realized that someone out there had to have known how to make computers and tell them what to do, even if I wasn't quite sure how. Sometimes I'm still not sure how. Luckily, I can, and will, learn. I like to focus on continual, fast-paced improvement of my skills without focusing too much on my failures, which I'm sure there will be many more of. I strive to not only be a better programmer, but also a better person. At the end of the day why wouldn't you be both?
          </p>
          <p> I've been pursuing this major for all of my time thus far at Dartmouth, and have coded in Java, Javascript, C, and Python. More recently, I have been taking an Algorithms class with Dr.Thomas Cormen, who is, as he will tell you, one of the four co-authors of the famous CLRS Intro to Algorithms textbook. While challenging, I find that the problems posed in that class have sparked my creativity in a way that I feel no other subject does. As always, I find the subject matter challenging, but rewarding. My primary interest now is to apply my computer science knowledge to make something with real-world impact outside of class.

            <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>
              While a majority of my time is spent in the library, when I do get out I have a few other primary interests. I am on the executive board of Club Biathlon and the Dartmouth Mountaineering Club, both sports I enjoy. Besides this, I am active in the Women in Computer Science club on campus, and enjoy both studio art and photography.
